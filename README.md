# Just Notes from Opie

This is my personal blog discussing my thoughts and programming for AutoCAD and Civil 3D using the AutoLISP programming language.

My experience with AutoCAD and Civil 3D has grown over the last two decades. My programming was necessitated by the need to automate tasks to standardize output and increase efficiancy in CAD drafting and design.

Additional thoughts may arise outside of AutoCAD, Civil 3D, or even AutoLISP.
