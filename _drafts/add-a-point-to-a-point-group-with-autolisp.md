With [last week's post]({% post_url 2016-01-14-add-a-point-group-from-the-command-line %}), I showed how to add a Point Group to your Civil 3D drawing.  Of course, only creating point groups isn't the most useful automation tool.  We need a way to add points to point groups without going through all of the manual steps.
